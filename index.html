Yet, large gaps in understanding thespecific impact of COVID-19, particularly in poor rural contexts and across different groups remain. One challenge is that food insecurity impacts in rural areas are confounded by strong seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations that characterize rural economic life. We estimate average andistributional effects of COVID-19 on food insecurity, combining localized weather data with mnthly household panel data collected since 2017 in Malawi, and since 2018 in Madagascar. COVID-19 had a significant negative impact in 2020, exacerbating pre-existing inequalities. Inaawi, 80% of the most food insecure households pre-pandemic were considerably worse off in 2020 than they would have been otherwise. In Madagascar, COVID-19 coincided with catastrophic drought resulting in crisis conditions that disproportionately impacted the most food insecure. Not accounting for seasonal and inter-annual variation risks mischaracterizing the inequitable impacts of CVD-19 on food insecurity.</div>

                          <div class="panel-body">The Philippines is highly exposed to natural hazards, including tropical storms and cyclones. Between 2006 and 2016, eighty-five storms caused over eleven thousand fatalities in the country. Many of the areas affected by tropical cyclones also suffer from chronic poverty and weak institutional capacity. The disproportionate vulnerability of the poor to natural hazards amplifies concerns that the people and communities most in need of adaptation lack the financial resources and institutional capacity to address the risks associated with climate change. In this paper, I investigate whether short-term changes in local poverty rates and government fiscal capacity impact tropical cyclone mortality in the Philippines. I construct and analyze a new panel dataset of tropical cyclone mortality, poverty rates, and local government financial flows for 78 provinces from 2005-2016 and 1,468 municipalities from 2007-2016. I also control for hazard exposure using high-resolution parametrically modeled wind speeds and population data. This improves precision of the estimates and corrects for biases that would otherwise be introduced by the correlation of poverty and cyclone exposure in the data. I demonstrate that aggregate statistics at the national and even provincial scales can obscure large heterogeneities in socioeconomically produced vulnerabilities. I find evidence that short-term changes in the share of people living in poverty impact tropical cyclone mortality risk at the municipal level.</div>

Looking beyond the direct effects of observable shocks and individual or household resilience capacities to the meso-level mechanisms that shape impacts on communities, households, and individuals can both guide our understanding of COVID-19 impacts and help leverage findings from the pandemic context to better understand resilience to future food systems shocks. We develop a conceptual framework for the multiple paths through which observed, exogenous shocks interact with systemic, endogenous mechanisms to influence the resilience of household well-being and supporting food systems. We illustrate this framework with reference to the COVID-19 pandemic and policy responses as they unfolded in three rural study areas in Malawi, Madagascar, and Kenya. Consistent with this framework, we find multiple pathways through which the pandemic shock affected household food security and resilience. Our findings highlight that in some settings, at some points in the multi-stressor trajectory of a shock, the direct effects – in this case, infection with SARS-CoV-2 – may be grave for those who experience them but far less impactful in aggregate than the indirect impacts for society as a whole. Indirect impacts arise as behaviors, markets, and policies adjust to the shock, and they may affect entire populations. These adjustments are necessarily correlated and elicit varied household coping responses. We illustrate the degree to which, from the point of view of rural food systems and households, COVID-19 is less a new shock than a dramatic, recent manifestation of familiar stressors and uncertainties that burden poor rural populations in much of the low- and middle-income world.</div>

Yet, while poverty and under-development are widely believed to be important risk factors for disaster mortality, empirical evidence of how development interventions are likely to impact mortality risk from natural hazards is scarce. Here, I investigate the potential for leveraging policy experiments for causal inference about the effects of development interventions on disaster mortality using an existing randomized control trial from the Philippines. I find that while randomization overcomes issues of multicollinearity and omitted variable bias, large heterogeneities in exposure and vulnerability over time and place compromise the balance of the treatment and control groups. This can result in highly imprecise average treatment effect estimates. Using an example from the Philippines, I illustrate the challenges of constructing a credible counterfactual for a community-level intervention in the presence of natural hazards.</div>

                          <div class="panel-body">Development and humanitarian agencies have rapidly embraced the concept of resilience since the 2008 global financial and food price crises. We report the results of a formal scoping review of the literature on development resilience over the ensuing period. The review identifies the theoretical and methodological underpinnings and empirical applications of resilience as the concept has been applied to individual or household well-being in low-and middle-income countries. From 9,558 search records spanning 2008-20, 301 studies met our pre-registered inclusion criteria. Among these, we identify three broad conceptualizations employed – resilience as capacity, as a normative condition, or as return to equilibrium – and explain how the resulting variation in framing leads to marked differences in empirical methods and findings. We study in greater depth a set of 45 studies that met five key criteria for empirical studies of resilience. The larger, more established, qualitative empirical literature yields insights suggestive that the concept of resilience can add value. The quantitative literature is thinner and divided among methods that limit cross-study comparability of findings. Overall, we find that development resilience remains inconsistently theorized and reliant on methods that have not been adequately reconciled to identify which tools are best suited to which questions. Despite much published evidence, most findings concentrate on just a few countries and natural shocks, and rely on cross-sectional data at just one scale of analysis. The result is a dearth of generalizable evidence, especially of rigorous impact evaluations, to guide whether or how agencies might build resilience among target populations.</div>

                          <div class="panel-body">Strong institutions as well as economic development are generally understood to play critical roles in protecting societies from the adverse impacts of natural hazards, such as tropical cyclones. The independent effect of institutions on reducing these risks, however, has not been confirmed empirically in previous global studies. As a storm's path and intensity influence the severity of the damages and may be spatially correlated with human vulnerabilities, failing to accurately capture the physical exposure in an econometric analysis may result in imprecise and possibly biased estimates of the influence of the independent variables. Here, we develop a novel approach to control for the physical exposure by spatially interacting meteorological and socioeconomic data for over one-thousand tropical cyclone disasters from 1979 to 2016. We find new evidence that higher levels of national government effectiveness are associated with lower tropical cyclone mortality, even when controlling for other socioeconomic conditions such as GDP per capita. Within countries, deaths are higher when strong winds are concentrated over areas of the country with weaker or less inclusive institutions. These results suggest that policies and programs to enhance institutional capacity and governance can support risk reduction from extreme weather events.</div>

                            <div class="panel-body">This special issue on “Bridging Research and Policy on Climate Change and Conflict” brings together the results of a 2018 workshop organized by the Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO) and the Wilson Center with six papers that address different aspects of the translation of the research on climate change and conflict to policy and practice. Here, we provide an overview of the workshop and papers to highlight key opportunities and challenges to linking the climate-conflict scholarship with pressing issues in diplomacy, development, and security. Multiple methods, especially comparative case studies, should be applied to elucidate the more complex mechanisms of the climate-conflict link. This approach may also enhance engagement with the policymakers who draw on examples and narratives. There is also a need for both predictive models that capture contextual factors and policy interactions as well as decision-support tools, such as integrated assessment models, that can be used to test the implications of different theories and models in the literature. Scholars should engage the policy community to formulate research questions that are more policy relevant, such as the effectiveness of interventions. There is also the need for models and frameworks that help practitioners synthesize the academic results. Practitioners are encouraged to leverage the comparative advantages of academic researchers in new policy and projects to inform data collection and future analysis of effectiveness.</div>

                            <div class="panel-body">Greater investments in community college workforce education are fostering large-scale partnerships between employers and educators. However, the evaluation work in this area has focused on outcome and productivity metrics, rather than addressing measures of implementation quality, which is critical to scaling any innovation. To deepen understanding of the field, sound metrics need to be assembled of the processes involved in workforce education (e.g., partnering with employers, designing and delivering instruction). This article addresses that gap with the Workforce Education Implementation Evaluation (WEIE) framework. Relying on five case studies of employer-community college collaborations, and drawing on labor market analysis methods, partnership capital and regional ecosystem theory, and the learning sciences, the WEIE framework provides tools to characterize implementation quality. To illustrate how it works, we have applied the framework to two contrasting cases that represent the predominant approaches to engaging employers in workforce education programming: large-scale partnership and employer outreach.</div>
